        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>In this work, we consider AI agents operating in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)---a widely-used framework 
        for sequential decision making with incomplete state information. 
        Agents operating with partial information take actions not only to advance their 
        underlying goals but also to seek information and reduce uncertainty. 
        Despite rapid progress in explainable AI, research on separating information-driven vs.~goal-driven behaviors remains sparse. 
        To address this gap, we introduce a novel explanation generation framework called <strong>Sequential Information Probing (SIP)</strong>, 
        to investigate the direct impact of state information, or its absence, on agent behavior. 
        To quantify the impact we also propose two metrics under this SIP framework 
        called <strong>Value of Information (VoI)</strong> and <strong>Influence of Information (IoI)</strong>. 
        We then theoretically derive several properties of these metrics. Finally, we present several experiments, 
        including a case study on an autonomous vehicle, that illustrate the efficacy of our method.</p>
